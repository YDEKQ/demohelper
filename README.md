*DemoHelper* is an annotation and screen zoom tool you can use for technical
presentations that include application demonstrations.

It can also show an overlay indicating which key-shortcut you entered or which mousebutton you clicked,
which is also useful when recording screencasts.

*DemoHelper* runs unobtrusively in the system tray and is activated by either customizable
otkeys or the context menu of the tray icon.

You can draw on the screen to mark special areas, or you can zoom in on an area on the screen.
